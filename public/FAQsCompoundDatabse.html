  <summary>What type of compound database does El-MAVEN use?</summary>
  <p>The compound database is made differently for different kinds of data. Some of the essential columns are the compound name, compound formula (necessary for labeled analysis) or m/z. To do targeted analysis one can also add RT column. You can also refer to these documents to understand more about the compounds DBs for MS and MS/MS data.</p>
